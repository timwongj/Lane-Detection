#### Overview
- Lane Detection is the process of identifying the road markers utilizing advanced computer vision techniques.
- Goal was to implement dynamic lane detection
- Current computer vision algorithm works well in ideal conditions
    - Bright day, Visible Lines, Clear Field of View
- Also, performs well under harsh conditions
    - Minor Obstructions, Shadows, No Lanes and Wide Lanes
- Algorithm dynamically adjusts to adapt to road conditions

Note: Our Advanced Lane Detection algorithm is based off of Mehdi Sqalli's code, found here: https://github.com/MehdiSv/AdvancedLineDetection
